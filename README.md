# üìñ Hello-Microverse

> Description 

The goal of this project is to set up linters in your HTML and CSS project to improve the quality of your code and help catch errors and potential issues. Linters are tools that let you check your code to make sure it follows coding best practices. By using this project, you will be able to improve the quality of your code and save time by avoiding common mistakes.



## üõ† Built With 

This project was carried out using the following tools:

Visual Studio Code - an open source and free code editor

Terminal - a terminal emulator for running commands

GitHub - a software development platform based on Git

ESLint - a JavaScript linter to detect coding errors and potential issues

Stylelint - a CSS linter to detect syntax errors and formatting issues in CSS files




### Tech Stack

This project was carried out using the following technologies:

HTML - the standard markup language for creating web pages
CSS - a style language used to define the presentation of web pages
GitHub - a software development platform based on Git


### Key Features

- Configuring and using linters to improve the quality of HTML and CSS code
- Detection of errors and potential problems in the code through the use of linters
- Help in implementing good coding practices in HTML and CSS
- Ability to automate code quality checking to save time and avoid common mistakes

## üíª Getting Started 



### Prerequisites

These instructions will allow you to configure linters to improve the quality of your HTML and CSS code.

Requirements
Before you begin, you must have the following installed on your computer:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (usually included with Node.js)

- Install
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command(cmd):

cmd : git clone https://github.com/your_user/your_project.git*

- Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

Install dependencies by running the following command(cmd):

cmd : npm install

- Use
- To run linters and check the quality of your HTML and CSS code, run the following command:

cmd : npm run lint

This command will run the linters for your HTML and CSS code and let you know of any issues it finds.

To customize the linter rules, you can modify the linter configuration file (for example, .eslintrc for ESLint or .stylelintrc for stylelint) in the root directory of the project.

These instructions should allow you to configure linters and check the quality of your HTML and CSS code. Feel free to customize these instructions to suit your project, its requirements, and the specific dependencies needed for your linters setup.



### Setup and Install

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

  cd my-folder
  git@github.com:GhostEsso/Hello-Microverse.git
	
If you want to use the linters setup in your own project, you can follow these instructions to integrate it into your project.

Requirements
To integrate the linters configuration into your project, you must have the following installed on your computer:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (usually included with Node.js)
Facility
Create a new directory where you want to include the linters configuration.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory you just created.

Run the following command to initialize your project and create a package.json file:


npm init -y

Install the linters dependencies by running the following command:



npm install --save-dev eslint stylelint

Copy the linters configuration files to your project by running the following command:


npx degit https://github.com/your_user/your_project/linters-config.
This command will copy the linters configuration files from your GitHub repository to your local project.

You can customize linter rules by modifying configuration files (for example, .eslintrc for ESLint or .stylelintrc for stylelint) in your project's root directory.

These instructions should allow you to integrate the configuration of linters into your project and check the quality of your HTML and CSS code. Feel free to customize these instructions to suit your project, its requirements, and the specific dependencies needed for your linters setup.


### Run tests

Open a terminal and navigate to your project's root directory.

Run the following command to run ESLint and check the quality of your HTML code:


npx eslint **/*.html

Run the following command to run stylelint and check the quality of your CSS code:


npx stylelint "**/*.css"

These commands will run the linters and tell you about errors and warnings in your HTML and CSS code.
